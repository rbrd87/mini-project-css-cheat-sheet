# CSS Cheat Sheet
<hr>

## Description üìù

For our lesson activity, I was required to re-create a cheat sheet design using various CSS properties we had used previously. Creating mini cards for code snippets for users to be able to select and copy into their code. 

## Learning Points üí°

- I used CSS variables within this project for repeated property values such as colours. 
- This was the first time we had used the `<pre>` tag in our HTML and doing so made the text in the code snippet appear as it should with the correct indentations etc. 
- I used transition effects for when the 'cards' load on the page to and also used the `:hover` selector to add an effect when the user hovers over the card.
- Again we used `@media` queries to help with the resizing of the content for smaller screens. 

In all it was quite a tough project for our first week, recalling previous CSS properties we had learnt and using them to create something from scratch was pretty rewarding. Although I did not complete it during the 45 minutes we were given in class, I was able to continue working on it in the evening after class and added the finishing touches the following morning.

As mentioned above it was the first time I had used CSS Variables within my code and it made it look a lot neater and tidier, which I was pretty happy about üòÑ

And finally here are some little code snippets of my HTML and CSS to see how I went about creating the little cards for each code snippet.
